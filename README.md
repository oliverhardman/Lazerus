# Lazerus ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

Lazerus is a 2-sided computer marketplace for the 21st century. Each year we generate around 40 million tons of electronic waste, worldwide. That’s like throwing 800 laptops every second. We at Lazerus believe we have the solution. Why throw away your laptop when you could sell it for a quick buck?

## Design Decisions
### Colours

The team at Lazerus were inspired by colourful websites from our friends at [Tens](https://tens.co/) and [Supremo.](https://www.supremo.co.uk/) Our aim was to create a website that used colours efficiently to draw in the customers eyes and introduce flow to the website. For these reasons we decided on the a bumblebee yellow and black colour theme.

### Fonts

For us Bulma was an attractive CSS framework as opposed to Bootstrap. This came down to just how popular Bootstrap is! as a result bootstrap can become a bit of an eye strain when used so frequently. Bulmas font 'Triomphe Light' was a breath of fresh air that matched our modern, clean & futuristic look.

### UX

As previously stated at Lazerus we strived for a modern, clean & futuristic look. The User experience had to reflect that. Our aim was to create a concise/clean flow for the user to follow. We did not want our customers stumbling around the website looking for the cart or trying to navigate through website. We wanted the customer to be 'in and out'. In the sense that an order could be completed in as little time as possible. 

### User Stories

* Login/Sign functionality + user restrictions
* Buy/Sell a computer
* Card Payments
* Transactional emails containing a reciept
* Search/filter through products
* Upload Images

## Planning

### Trello
During the project the Lazerus Team decided on using Trello. Following the agile methodology we were able to stay on track with our project plan and complete the project.

## Future Improvements 

### Trading Functionality

Trading functionality would give the buyer/seller more choice with how they want to part with the Computer. This feature would also distinguish Lazerus from the competition eg (Amazon/EBay). 

### Admin Dashboard

A future service that would allow admin privileges. Thus providing the ability to edit, show and delete listing and generally monitor the Lazerus marketplace.

### Internal Messaging Service

A feature integrated with the users facebook account that would grant access to Support Workers from Lazerus. Allowing website problems to be discovered faster & maintain customer satisfaction.

### Custom Domain name

A custome domain name would increase credibility to the Lazerus Marketplace and help with SEO optimisation.

### PayPal Payments

Card payments are essential to any marketplace. But in todays day and age many people feel more confident with supplying their PayPal credentials rather than a credit-card/debit-card. This would help Lazerus attract a larger user-base and add to the professionality of the Marketplace
